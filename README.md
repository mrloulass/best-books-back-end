## Getting Started

1. Create github repo and make a git clone on local computer
2. Install all dependencies: `dotenv, express, mongoose and cors`
3. Create `.gitignore` and `.env` file. Next add PORT and DATABASE_URL environment variables in `.env` file.
4. Follow Mongoose  docs on getting started: [Mongoose Docs](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html)
5. Send a `GET` to `/route name` requesting user from the database, and return them in the response.
6. On the Front-end Create a `NEW Component` to manage book data retrieval and display.

[Express JS](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html): A web frameork for Node.js

[NPM JS package: dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): Storing configuration in the environment separate from the code base.

[NPM JS package: cors](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html): Allow REACT app forntend to access data from server

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home): Used to up load server app.
